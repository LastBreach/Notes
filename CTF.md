# Capture-The-Flag Competitions & Challenges

Here's a list of websites regarding CTF competitions or challenges. Feel free to add any that are missing.

## CTF Tournaments

I haven't checked each of those sites in detail, if you feel one if in the wrong category, let me know.

  * https://www.pentestit.ru/ - Looks like CTFs, but then again, I don't speak russian.

### Pro Tip

If you're going to do challenges, document them. Documentation is a vital part of penetration testing, and it requires practice just as everything else does. If you're looking for a good tool to take notes, I recommend ZIM desktop wiki. It's available for Mac/Linux/Windows. It automatically moves any screenshots you drag&drop into docs to the right location, so you won't loose your images when you move the notebooks folder. Also, it save a ton of time.

Another suggestion was TiddlyWiki (web based), but I have no experience with it.
